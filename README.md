# Tempest Fitness Journal
This is a fitness journal made to record and track your journey to peak physical fitness. The goal is to be able to track various exercises and workouts, in order to see over time how your fitness metrics are improving. Most tracking apps only show you overall weightloss or the present metrics, but Tempest is made so you can actually see the progression and continue to be motivated by progress.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Tailwind, DaisyUI, Node, Express, Passport, MongoDB

This project is completely Full-stack with an MVC file structure. I initially designed this application with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript, but expanded upon it with a multitude of other technologies. Each front-end page was created and designed using EJS, as well as Tailwind for the CSS. I utilized some components and theming structure through DaisyUI. I have routed every link in the Routes folder through NodeJS & ExpressJS. I implemented logins via Passport through NPM and incorporated MongoDB to store the credentials. It is a completely fullstack CRUD app where you can add and retrieve data from MongoDB including workouts, cardio, strength, weights lifted and a ton of other metrics.

## Optimizations

Here are some updates I plan on adding in the future:

- Implement a React libray to better structure the views.
- ChartJS to display more metricts information.
- Edit & Delete functions.
- Optimize speed and responsiveness.
- Add a light/dark mode toggle.
- User settings and profile images.

## Lessons Learned:

This project has given me a very thorough understanding of MVC structure as well as routing and designing using NodeJs and libraries such as Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI. I learned how to properly structure data in the Models to get served to MongoDB through the Controllers and then be displayed in the View. I also became familiar with properly routing all my views to be linked to each other using the website navigation. Finally i was able to configure the pages to be able to display data from MongoDb how I wanted in my Views. I have learned so many things from building this project and plan to continue improving it.
